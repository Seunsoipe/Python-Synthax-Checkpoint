# Python-Synthax-Checkpoint
Objective
Before you start, you will need Python installed on your computer, install python by following the steps shown in this chapter and then open your jupyter notebook (Just go to the anaconda navigator and click on Jupyter Notebook). And then you will practice the manipulation of the basic data types of python as well as condition control and loops.

Instructions
Part 1: 

Question 1: Write a Python program that accepts an integer (n) and computes the value of n+nn+nnn

Sample value of n is 5 

Expected Result : 615 (5+55+555)

Question 2

Write a Python program to find whether a given number (accept from the user) is even or odd, print out an appropriate message to the user.

Question 3 

Write a program which will find all such numbers which are divisible by 7 but are not a multiple of 5, between 2000 and 3200 (both included). The numbers obtained should be printed in a sequence on a single line.

Hints: Consider use range(#begin, #end) method

Question 4

Write a program which can compute the factorial of a given numbers. The results should be printed in a sequence on a single line. Suppose the following input is supplied to the program: 8 Then, the output should be: 40320 

Question 5

Write a program to remove the characters which have odd index values of a given string.

for example: string ="hello team"

result should be: hlota
